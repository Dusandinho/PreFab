# PreFab
`PreFab` (Prediction of Fabrication) is used for modelling fabrication process induced variations in integrated photonic devices using deep convolutional neural networks.

Trained models predict variations such as corner rounding (both over and under etching), washing away of small lines and islands, and filling of narrow holes and channels in planar photonic structures. Once predicted, the designer resimulates their design to rapidly prototype the expected performance and make any necessary corrections prior to (costly) fabrication.

This repository includes the tools used in the paper `Deep Learning Based Prediction of Fabrication-Process-Induced Structural Variations in Nanophotonic Devices` (which can be viewed [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.1c01973)).

## Getting Started
Please see the notebooks in `/examples` to get started with making predictions in `PreFab`.

## Models
The models currently included in `/models` are of the NanoSOI process from [Applied Nanotools Inc.](https://www.appliednt.com/nanosoi-fabrication-service/) These are alpha-stage models that are currently in development.

## Authors
`PreFab` was written by Dusan Gostimirovic with Odile Liboiron-Ladouceur (McGill University), Dan-Xia Xu (National Research Council of Canada), and Yuri Grinberg (National Research Council of Canada).
