The bright line of this plot is where the edge is most likely to be, but in reality, there is a range of possible locations. For finer features (e.g., the narrow channel in the plot below at x = 200, y = 170), we see that uncertainty is increased and the range of possible edge positions is larger! This channel may be bridged for some runs and remain open for others. This is a sign that we want to avoid using these types of features for our device if possible."
